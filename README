Okay so the purpose of these scripts is to do some creative messing about with AudioMulch.

The first problem is with recorded automation data. Recording knob movement
generates a *lot* of data which can be a pain to edit in the automation pane.
So we're going to try and filter and smooth that into something more useful.

The first curvesmoother (probably the wrong name but...) halves the number
of automation points by averaging adjacent points (except the first and last
points which remain fixed). Again probably not very useful but it's a proof of
concept for more useful utilities (e.g. convolution with Gaussian kernel whatever
the hell that means :))

To use you will need Ruby 1.8 and the trollop and nokogiri gems installed. Then

./curvesmooth saved_patch.amh GadgetName PropertyName

e.g.

./curvesmooth my_patch.amh BubbleBlower_1 Amplitude

which will write a new patch as 'saved_patch_sm.amh'. Your existing patch is never
modified.

Note that this version has only been tested with min/max properties such as the
BubbleBlower Amplitude. Single valued parameters won't work yet.

If you test it out let me know, Matt <self@mattmower.com>
